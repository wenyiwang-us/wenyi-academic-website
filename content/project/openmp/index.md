title: The Interweaving Project
summary: Our contribution is that we brought OpenMP implementation to the kernel in three different approaches - *runtime in kernel* (RTK), *process in kernel* (PIK) and *custom compilation for kernel* (CCK). Notably, the average performance gain of our RTK approach across scales and benchmarks is on the order of 22% (geometric mean) compared to Linux user-level code.
