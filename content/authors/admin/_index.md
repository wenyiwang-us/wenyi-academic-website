I am Wenyi Wang (王文意), a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Chicago.
I am currently advised by Prof. [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/) and Prof. [Ian Foster](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/ian-foster/), as a member of the [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/).


I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/), where I was fortunate to work with, and be advised by, Prof. [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) in [Prescience Lab](http://presciencelab.org/).


I am broadly interested in Parallel Computing and Open-Source Software. My current focus is to enable finer-grained parallel tasking runtime on OpenMP.
