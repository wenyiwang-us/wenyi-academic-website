I am Wenyi Wang (王文意), a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Chicago.
I am currently co-advised by Prof. [Ian Foster](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/ian-foster/), Prof. [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/) and Prof. [Yanjing Li](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~yanjingl/).
I am also part of the [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/).

Before, I was a research assistant in the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/projects/) at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), working closely with Dr. [Camilo Rojas](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/camilorq/overview/) and Prof. [Pattie Maes](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/pattie/overview/).
I was also actively collaborating as a research intern in [Xu lab](https://xulabs.github.io/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/).


I am broadly interested in Systems and Artificial Intelligence, including Systems for AI/ML, AI/ML for Systems, distributed systems, cloud computing and HPC.

I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/), where I was fortunate to work with, and be advised by, Prof. [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) in [Prescience Lab](http://presciencelab.org/).
Prior to that, I graduated from [Northeastern University, China](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) with B.E. in Software Engineering.
