I am Wenyi Wang (王文意), a research intern in the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/projects/) at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), working closely with Dr. [Camilo Rojas](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/camilorq/overview/).
I am also actively helping as a research intern in [Xu lab@CBD_SCS_CMU](https://xulabs.github.io/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/).


I have broad research interests in Computer Systems, High Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and especially the intersection of them.

I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/), where I was very fortunate to work with, and be advised by, Prof. [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) in [Prescience Lab](http://presciencelab.org/).
Prior to that, I graduated from [Northeastern University, China](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) with B.E. in Software Engineering.
